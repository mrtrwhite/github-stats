Furthermore, expose the\r\nfunctionality to return a detailed error message (with path names, etc)\r\nfor logs and a bare bones message for CRDB users.\r\n\r\nThe lazy loading makes it easier for tests to not require loading it up\r\nthemselves each time, whilst the server initializing allows us to display\r\na full error message in the logs whereas people performing geospatial\r\noperations without GEOS properly set up do not see internal server set\r\nup info.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed the dlsym/dlerr access pattern to check whether the dlsym'd\r\nobject is NULL before returning dlerr. This errors on some systems with\r\n`_nss_cache_cycle_prevention_function`.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/47332\r\n\r\nRelease note: None\n\n47356: opt: remove VirtualScan operator r=RaduBerinde a=RaduBerinde\n\nThis change removes the `VirtualScan` operator and uses `Scan` for virtual\r\ntables. This reduces code duplication and allows all the optimizations related\r\nto `Scan` to function for virtual tables as well.\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty (which lead to the special operator) is that virtual tables\r\ndon't have a primary key. We fix this by adding a dummy, hidden PK column\r\n(always column 0) and presenting a primary index on it. We don't actually\r\nsupport scanning this column (if you try to select it by name explicitly, you\r\nwill get an error in the exec factory).\r\n\r\nThis change will make it easier to add \"real\" indexes to improve virtual table\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nRelease note: None\n\nCo-authored-by: Oliver Tan <otan@cockroachlabs.com>\nCo-authored-by: Radu Berinde

calls to the shellescape() function (#1099)\n\n* Improve \"g:NERDTreeQuickLook()\"\r\n\r\nThe following improvements were made...\r\n\r\n  - Use variable sigils\r\n  - Shorten a local variable name\r\n  - Prefer an early return over testing for a negative\r\n  - Switch to single quotes\r\n  - Call \"shellescape()\" to pass a command argument [IMPORTANT!]\r\n\r\nThe final change is a critical fix for the security and reliability\r\nof this function (see \":h system()\").\r\n\r\nSimilar fixes for the other functions in this script will follow.\r\n\r\n* Improve \"g:NERDTreeRevealInFinder()\"\r\n\r\nThis commit makes several style improvements and adds a missing call\r\nto the \"shellescape()\" function.\r\n\r\nSee also:

However, there\r\nare only two.  I suppose I should have taken the time to look.\r\n\r\nFixing these was easy.  I would be surprised if this change breaks\r\nanything on the user side.\r\n\r\n* Update the \"CHANGELOG.md\" file (again)\r\n\r\nUse a more fitting description of the

For example, it was disabled if multiple wallets were used and would not work with encrypted wallets that were being upgraded to HD.\n\n  This PR does away with the old method of upgrading upon startup and instead allows users to upgrade their wallets via an `upgradewallet` RPC. This does largely the same thing as the old `-upgradewallet` option but because the wallet is loaded, it can be unlocked to upgrade to HD. Furthermore it is compatible with multiwallet as it works on the individual wallet that is specified by the RPC.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  meshcollider:\n    Code review ACK 0d32d661481f099af572e7a08a50e17bcc165c44\n  darosior:\n    ACK 0d32d661481f099af572e7a08a50e17bcc165c44\n  MarcoFalke:\n    ACK 0d32d661481f099af572e7a08a50e17bcc165c44 🚵\n\nTree-SHA512: b425bf6f5d605e26506889d63c780895482f07cbc086193218e031e8504d3072d41e90d65cd41bcc98ee4c1eb048954bc5d4ac85435f7394892373aac89a3b0a","lastCommitDate":"2020-04-19 11:06:27","lastCommitTimestamp":1587294387,"lastRelease":"Bitcoin Core 0.19.1","lastReleaseDate":"2020-03-09 19:58:58","lastReleaseTimestamp":1583783938},{"name":"ansible/ansible","stars":42704,"forks":18847,"lastCommit":"Update docs, pointing to an existing chapter.

These can be used to set the priority that SQL transactions use by default, on a per-session basis. The accepted options for the setting are `LOW`, `NORMAL`, and `HIGH`. The default value is `NORMAL`.\r\n\r\nOne area where this setting is useful is to give priority to one application's traffic over that of another application. Because this is implemented as a session variable, it can be provided as a session parameter in the PG connection URL.\r\n\r\nRelease note (sql change): A new default_transaction_priority session variable is now supported, which configures the priority that SQL transactions use by default. The accepted options for the setting are `LOW`, `NORMAL`, and `HIGH`.\n\nCo-authored-by: Nathan VanBenschoten <nvanbenschoten@gmail.com>","lastCommitDate":"2020-04-18

persistent worker stdout/stderr to buffer\n\nIn certain circumstances the various android compilation tools could output to stdout while operating as a persistent worker which would lead to a corruption of the response protobuf and ultimately lead to a failed build.\n\nThis PR solves that problem by redirecting all stdout and stderr emitted by the worker to an in-memory buffer that is later attached to the proto response as an output. In this way, all future tools added to the tool wrapper can benefit from having their output logged rather than cause a build

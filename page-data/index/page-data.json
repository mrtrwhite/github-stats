It does this by wrapping the `setTimeout` call in a\r\ncheck to see if it's in an `act` context. If so, it skips the delay and\r\nimmediately commits the fallback.\r\n\r\nReally this is only meant for our internal React tests that need to\r\nincrementally render. Nobody outside our team (and Relay) needs to do\r\nthat, yet. Even if/when we do support that, it may or may not be with\r\nthe same `flushAndYield` pattern we use internally.\r\n\r\nHowever, even for our internal purposes, the behavior isn't right\r\nbecause a really common reason we flush work incrementally is to make\r\nassertions on the \"suspended\" state, before the fallback has committed.\r\nThere's no way to do that from inside `act` with the behavior of this\r\nflag, because it causes the fallback to immediately commit. This has led\r\nus to *not* use `act` in a lot of our tests, or to write code that\r\ndoesn't match what would actually happen in a real environment.\r\n\r\nWhat we really want is for the fallbacks to be flushed at the *end` of\r\nthe `act` scope. Not within it.\r\n\r\nThis only affects the noop and test renderer versions of `act`, which\r\nare implemented inside the reconciler. Whereas `ReactTestUtils.act` is\r\nimplemented in \"userspace\" for backwards compatibility. This is fine\r\nbecause we didn't have any DOM Suspense tests that relied on this flag;\r\nthey all use test renderer or noop.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we'll probably want to move always use the reconciler\r\nimplementation of `act`. It will not affect the prod bundle, because we\r\ncurrently only plan to support `act` in dev. Though we still haven't\r\ncompletely figured that out. However, regardless of whether we support a\r\nproduction `act` for users, we'll still need to write internal React\r\ntests in production mode. For that use case, we'll likely add our own\r\ninternal version of `act` that assumes a mock Scheduler and might rely\r\non hacks that don't 100% align up with the public one.","lastCommitDate":"2020-04-14 03:02:18","lastCommitTimestamp":1586833338,"lastRelease":"16.13.1 (March 19, 2020)","lastReleaseDate":"2020-03-19

When a function type is the return type of an arrow function, a parse error will occur as the arrow from the arrow function will be interpreted as part of the function type. To avoid this we must wrap the entire function type in parentheses if it is the return type of an arrow function.\n\n```\n// Errors\n(): (x) => y => {}\n\n// OK\n(): ((x) => y) => {}\n```\n\nNote that this is only a syntax error when the function type has params. If the function type has an empty params list, or a params list that consists of just a rest param, then the function type does not need to be wrapped in parentheses.\n\n```\n// OK\n(): () => y => {}\n(): (...x) => y => {}\n```\n\nReviewed By: gkz\n\nDifferential Revision: D20970397\n\nfbshipit-source-id: b97095b928d88e3889b0a9df6e3807d11faefe47","lastCommitDate":"2020-04-13 22:28:14","lastCommitTimestamp":1586816894,"lastRelease":"","lastReleaseDate":"2020-04-02 05:00:45","lastReleaseTimestamp":1585803645},{"name":"alibaba/flutter-go","stars":20470,"forks":3045,"lastCommit":"招聘信息\n\n招聘信息","lastCommitDate":"2020-01-03 09:14:53","lastCommitTimestamp":1578042893,"lastRelease":null,"lastReleaseDate":null,"lastReleaseTimestamp":null},{"name":"CSSEGISandData/COVID-19","stars":20454,"forks":11144,"lastCommit":"Okaloosa correction","lastCommitDate":"2020-04-14 00:57:04","lastCommitTimestamp":1586825824,"lastRelease":null,"lastReleaseDate":null,"lastReleaseTimestamp":null},{"name":"airbnb/lottie-web","stars":20431,"forks":1966,"lastCommit":"version 5.6.9","lastCommitDate":"2020-04-12 00:55:03","lastCommitTimestamp":1586652903,"lastRelease":null,"lastReleaseDate":null,"lastReleaseTimestamp":null},{"name":"scwang90/SmartRefreshLayout","stars":20406,"forks":4254,"lastCommit":"发布 1.1.2 版本","lastCommitDate":"2020-03-17 15:31:35","lastCommitTimestamp":1584459095,"lastRelease":"V1.1.0 稳定版发布","lastReleaseDate":"2019-08-13 14:46:44","lastReleaseTimestamp":1565707604},{"name":"alibaba/arthas","stars":20396,"forks":4353,"lastCommit":"[maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration","lastCommitDate":"2020-04-11 15:31:28","lastCommitTimestamp":1586619088,"lastRelease":"","lastReleaseDate":"2020-04-11 15:33:48","lastReleaseTimestamp":1586619228},{"name":"elsewhencode/project-guidelines","stars":20391,"forks":2020,"lastCommit":"Fix typo","lastCommitDate":"2020-01-15 17:28:48","lastCommitTimestamp":1579109328,"lastRelease":null,"lastReleaseDate":null,"lastReleaseTimestamp":null},{"name":"eugenp/tutorials","stars":20389,"forks":32259,"lastCommit":"Merge pull request #9030 from gindex/master\n\nBAEL-3940 How to get String from Mono<String> in reactive java","lastCommitDate":"2020-04-14 06:10:33","lastCommitTimestamp":1586844633,"lastRelease":null,"lastReleaseDate":null,"lastReleaseTimestamp":null},{"name":"google/leveldb","stars":20385,"forks":4775,"lastCommit":"Remove leveldb::port::kLittleEndian.\n\nClang 10 includes the optimizations described in\nhttps://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41761.
